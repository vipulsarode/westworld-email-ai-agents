    Args:
        model (LanguageModelLike): The chat model that supports OpenAI tool calling.
        tools (Union[ToolExecutor, Sequence[BaseTool]]): A list of tools or a ToolExecutor instance.
        messages_modifier: (Optional[Union[SystemMessage, str, Callable, Runnable]]): An optional
            messages modifier. This applies to messages BEFORE they are passed into the LLM.
            Can take a few different forms:
            - SystemMessage: this is added to the beginning of the list of messages.
            - str: This is converted to a SystemMessage and added to the beginning of the list of messages.
            - Callable: This function should take in a list of messages and the output is then passed to the language model.
            - Runnable: This runnable should take in a list of messages and the output is then passed to the language model.
        checkpointer (Optional[BaseCheckpointSaver]): An optional checkpoint saver object.
        interrupt_before (Optional[Sequence[str]]): An optional list of node names to interrupt before.
        interrupt_after (Optional[Sequence[str]]): An optional list of node names to interrupt after.
        debug (bool): A flag indicating whether to enable debug mode.

    Returns:
        Runnable: A compiled LangChain runnable that can be used for chat interactions.
